1
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,726
Back then, not sleeping,
I'd lay awake thinking about women.

2
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,641
My daughter, my wife.

3
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,930
I mean, it's like

4
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,603
something's just got your name on it,
like a bullet

5
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,289
or a nail in the road.

6
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,643
Shit. Sorry. I drift.

7
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,887
Sometimes when I've had a few of this.

8
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,443
That's why I like to drink alone.
One reason, anyway.

9
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,328
- About that sculpture thing.
- Hmm.

10
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,049
Kind of strange it turns up like that,
years later.

11
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,566
Yeah, nobody knew
why that thing was in the playhouse.

12
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,562
I mean, the aunt reckoned maybe it was
something she made in school, you know.

13
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,771
To me, it was like someone
was having a conversation, you know.

14
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,761
Girl's school shut down in '92,
closed down after Andrew.

15
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,766
That mean anything to you?

16
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,486
Oh, we notified the deceased's mother.

17
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,811
Do you remember the last time
you saw your daughter Dora?

18
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,126
It was a horrible, horrible thing.

19
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,122
We saw it on TV.

20
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,927
What we were in the clutches of.

21
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,129
And I prayed,
I prayed for that woman's family.

22
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,851
And it's me.

23
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,966
It's me.

24
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,727
- Mrs. Kelly, what about her father?
- Hmm.

25
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,047
Did they have a relationship?

26
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,122
Why? What have you heard?

27
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,161
I heard he passed. Is that correct?

28
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,484
Why wouldn't a father bathe his own child?

29
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,249
Ahem.

30
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,163
We, uh, were just wondering
how they got on, ma'am.

31
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,924
He died on the road.

32
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,402
He drove a Peterbilt,
and he took an exit too fast.

33
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,003
Rolled over near Rowan, Oklahoma.

34
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,482
May 11th, 1984.

35
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,242
When was the last time you talked to her?

36
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,608
You know, she's always been
in some kind of trouble.

37
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,286
I thought things were getting better.

38
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,771
Got away from Charlie.

39
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,410
She came by not too long ago,
maybe a month.

40
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,528
She didn't talk about her daddy none.
Said she'd been going to church.

41
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,681
Do you, um, do you remember
where that church was?

42
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,361
Oh...

43
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,010
- Mrs. Kelly?
- No.

44
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,281
Ow.

45
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,046
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

46
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,202
Hail Mary, full of grace...

47
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,851
- Mrs. Kelly.
- I... I get these headaches.

48
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,607
It's like storms. Oh.

49
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,771
I worked in dry-cleaning for 20 years.

50
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,405
The chemicals.

51
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,244
That's what's wrong with my nails.

52
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,005
Piece of work, huh?

53
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,122
My mother, Donna Reed type.

54
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,922
Packed lunches, bedtime stories.

55
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,403
Your mom still alive?

56
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,646
Maybe.

57
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,848
Cohle ever talk about his parents?

58
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,890
No. Little bit. About his dad.

59
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,005
Alaska, 'Nam.

60
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,411
You know, my dad,
I had about, uh, six inches on him,

61
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,728
and even in the end,
I still think he could have taken me.

62
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,407
Yeah. Marines, Korea.

63
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,170
Never talked about it.

64
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,689
You know, there was a time that men
didn't air their bullshit to the world.

65
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,809
You know, it just wasn't
a part of their job.

66
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,768
Well, family.

67
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,290
Well, I mean, I...

68
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,728
I think a part of Rust's problem

69
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,691
was there was things he needed
that he couldn't admit to.

70
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,730
Afternoon, men.

71
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,600
So, we talked to
the victim's friend next, I believe.

72
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,291
Miss Carla?

73
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,485
I guess she always
had her mom's place,

74
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,486
but I thought maybe
she'd gotten into something, you know.

75
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,325
Like, uh, gaming, again.

76
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,649
Having a rough time.

77
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,007
What all did y'all talk about?

78
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,045
How was she?

79
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,851
Thin, loopy, like high.

80
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,245
She was on something.

81
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,924
She said she found a church,

82
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,080
but her eyes,

83
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,604
something wrong with them.

84
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,764
Now, do you remember
where this church was?

85
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,967
No.

86
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,401
You know
where she might have been staying?

87
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,006
Her landlord said
she'd moved out last summer.

88
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,003
That's when I stopped seeing her so much.

89
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,206
She mentioned someplace down south,
like around Spanish Lake.

90
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,248
A shelter, girls used to stay there,
something, all she said.

91
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,961
Hmm.

92
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,643
She sounds sad, Marty.

93
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,651
Like a torn up person on her last legs.

94
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,647
She was just an easy target for him.

95
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,845
What do we know about him?

96
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,409
Hits prosts, artistic,
religious in some kind of way.

97
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,285
Every person within a thousand miles of here
is religious in some kind of way, except you.

98
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,089
How many DBs have antlers,

99
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,846
blindfolds, painted symbols
on their back, hmm?

100
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,089
Yeah, you know what tweakers get up to.

101
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,804
Shit, man, this dude in New Orleans
cut up his girl, felt remorse,

102
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,082
tried to piece her back together
with Krazy Glue.

103
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,924
That's just drug insanity.

104
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,441
That's not this. This has scope.

105
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:18,129
Now, she articulated a person with vision.
Vision is meaning. Meaning is historical.

106
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,564
Look, she was just chum in the water, man.

107
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,364
Days of nothing.

108
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,806
That's what it's like, you work cases.

109
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,285
Days like lost dogs.

110
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,164
Goes on like that.

111
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,648
You know the job.

112
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,601
You're looking for narrative.

113
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,842
Interrogate witnesses.

114
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,849
Wake up, Daddy.

115
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,641
Parcel the evidence, establish a timeline,

116
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,167
and build a story day after day.

117
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,200
No! No!

118
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,288
Hey, the other night,
when you were over for dinner,

119
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,164
why didn't you leave when I had Chris call?

120
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,084
Mmm, I don't know.
I guess I had sobered up a little.

121
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,491
Besides, it wasn't as bad as I thought.

122
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,282
Being around your family.
I liked talking to them.

123
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,681
"Bad"?

124
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,806
Why'd you think that?

125
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,051
I was married, Marty, for three years.

126
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,044
We had a baby girl. She died.

127
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,360
Car accident. She was two years old.

128
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,888
Marriage couldn't handle it.

129
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,484
Your kid died?

130
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,125
Oh, I...

131
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,527
I'm sorry, man. I am so sorry. I didn't...

132
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,729
No, I mean, it wasn't you guys.
It was just me.

133
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,770
I was worried,

134
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,764
you know, being around that kind of thing.

135
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,930
Hey, you were married the once,
just the once?

136
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,163
Uh-huh. Came close another time.

137
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,526
Laurie.

138
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,769
Maggie introduced us.

139
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,647
It broke off.

140
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,443
It was for the best, you know.
I gave her cause.

141
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,324
I can be hard to live with. You know, I...

142
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,687
I don't mean to, but I can be critical.

143
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,487
And sometimes I think
I'm just not good for people.

144
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,761
You know, that it's not good for them
to be around me.

145
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,284
You know, I...
I wear them down.

146
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,088
- You know, they... They get unhappy.
- Hmm.

147
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,207
Yeah, I think the job does that
to a lot of guys. Changes you.

148
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,564
Some guys just notice, that's all.

149
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,530
Well, I can't say the job made me this way.

150
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,162
More like me being this way
made me right for the job.

151
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,490
I used to

152
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,722
think about it more,

153
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,167
but, you know, you reach a certain age,
you know who you are.

154
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,283
Now I live in a little room out
in the country, behind a bar.

155
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,164
Work four nights a week.
In between, I drink.

156
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,371
And there ain't nobody there to stop me.

157
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,084
I know who I am.

158
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,644
After all these years, there's a...
There's a victory in that.

159
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,007
Third day on the job,
stopped this cutie for speeding.

160
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,409
Fifty-two minutes later,
back in her dorm room.

161
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,411
I got my uniform around my knees.

162
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,529
I'm occupied, so I don't hear anything.

163
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,371
I don't know that her roommate
has come home and snuck up behind us.

164
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,441
Oh, shit.

165
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,285
You know how I knew
that she was in the room?

166
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,727
She stuck her finger up my ass!

167
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,886
Ruined me. Now I can't do without it.

168
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,647
You miss some things on the job.
You know what I mean.

169
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,122
You got to decompress before you can

170
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,089
go being a family man.

171
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,049
What you get into working,
you can't have the kids around that.

172
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,484
So, uh, sometimes you got
to get your head right.

173
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,164
Mind if I stop by?

174
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,528
I don't know. Where are you?

175
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,721
Elks.

176
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,085
- So you're drunk.
- No, I'm not.

177
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,123
I've hardly had anything to drink.

178
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,931
You never hardly have anything to drink.

179
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,047
I have a surprise for you.

180
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,684
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

181
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,729
- Is that a yes?
- I, uh, might stay up.

182
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,761
Ah.

183
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,165
It's for your wife and kids, too.

184
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,688
You got to take your release where
you find it or where it finds you.

185
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,162
I mean, in the end,
it's for the good of the family.

186
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,211
What's that?

187
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,411
Oh, well, I, uh, got you a present.

188
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,370
Don't move a muscle.

189
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,681
I shan't. Just the fingers.

190
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,844
The finger muscles.

191
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,561
Mmm.

192
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,249
Oh, stop.

193
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,685
- You're very naughty.
-  Yes.

194
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,807
You have the right to remain silent.

195
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,451
Anything you say

196
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,924
can and will be held against you
in a court of law.

197
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,761
You have the right to an attorney.

198
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,931
If you can't afford an attorney,
the State will provide you one.

199
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,884
Do you understand your rights?

200
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,003
You definitely have a career
in law enforcement.

201
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,806
Well, I thought I was
gonna put these on you.

202
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,565
You want this?

203
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,041
Yeah?

204
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,891
You want it?

205
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,041
Yes.

206
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,121
Mmm.

207
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,801
Mmm.

208
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,490
Now, what do you mean, exactly,
these visions you mentioned?

209
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,002
Oh, shit. I thought you knew.

210
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,163
I told Marty about them,
you know, down the line.

211
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,126
Uh, chemical flashbacks, neural damage,

212
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,169
you know, from my time in the HIDTA,

213
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,248
as in "High Intensity
Drug Trafficking Area."

214
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,081
I spent four years undercover.

215
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,522
You know what that means?

216
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,842
That's where they got them Fed rumors,
I first come in.

217
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,051
What, you two don't know about them?

218
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,287
Those files are still sealed, huh?

219
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,730
Shit.

220
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,811
Just what have you two heard about me?

221
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,610
You wanted Blues?

222
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,565
Quaaludes.

223
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,569
- Downers?
- Dopey stuff.

224
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,446
Oh.

225
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,521
What's it run?

226
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,251
I'm thinking Blue go for three a pill.

227
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,446
Then we'll say 200 for the bottle.

228
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,846
I thought you might just take them.

229
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,928
Or that you wanted something else.

230
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,488
Some kind of something else?

231
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,287
No.

232
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,851
Then I was thinking,
you're a good-looking man,

233
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,764
you wouldn't need a shakedown to get some.

234
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,290
What about rough trade? Scary guys?
You girls talk.

235
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,884
Around here, they're rough or whisky limp.

236
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,805
Seen plenty of guys that get touchy.

237
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,282
Something sets them off
and they're like little boys.

238
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,606
People always go away around here.

239
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,846
Where would I look?

240
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,011
Working girls might know the blond?

241
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,206
If she was gaming I-10 south side,
I heard of this place.

242
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,729
Kind of trailer park.

243
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,169
Girls work and stay.

244
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,451
They call it "The Ranch."

245
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,971
Where's that?

246
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,328
Like, south of Spanish
Lake, supposed to be.

247
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,849
You know the place?

248
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,644
What's your deal?

249
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,009
I don't have a deal.

250
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,083
I mean, what do you do?

251
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,044
Never mind.
I thought you were gonna bust me.

252
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,767
I told you, I'm not interested.

253
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,330
Yeah, I know.

254
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,806
You're kind of strange,
like you might be dangerous.

255
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,928
Well, of course I'm dangerous.

256
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,925
I'm police.

257
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,726
I can do terrible things to people

258
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,685
with impunity.

259
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,205
What'd you do last night?
I called up here late.

260
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,041
What were you doing?

261
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,566
Working.

262
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,080
Was thinking about dropping by.
Where were you?

263
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,650
I was out with girlfriends.

264
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,721
Uh-huh.

265
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,370
Well, I don't like that.

266
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,244
What, you're jealous?

267
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,050
Don't be stupid.

268
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,724
I just mean that there's
a crazy man out there,

269
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,842
and, uh, he's killing women.

270
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,404
Wait, you mean that girl again,
that Satanic thing?

271
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,882
Everyone's still talking about that
at the courthouse.

272
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,240
It's not just her.

273
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,245
There's more.

274
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,649
There's more? Really?

275
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,128
Yeah, well, we're not saying,
keeping it out of the press,

276
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,763
but we're thinking
that he's been doing this awhile.

277
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,321
Wow.

278
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,125
Yeah, so no need to go out.

279
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,487
You just have a drink here.

280
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,281
I can't meet a nice man at home.

281
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,928
That hurts me when you speak to me
in a passive-aggressive way.

282
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,931
I always talk straight to you.

283
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,004
Excuse me. I meant that
since you're married,

284
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,528
I need to be considering my options
as a young woman.

285
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,443
I want things, Marty.

286
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,131
I want things, too.

287
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,241
Yeah, you just want your cake
and to eat it, too.

288
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,442
The hell good is cake if you can't eat it?

289
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,286
Mmm.

290
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,806
Morning.

291
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,644
Hey, I think I might have
found something good.

292
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,963
Bunny ranch down south,
around Spanish Lake.

293
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,567
I thought we were pulling old johns today.

294
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,847
Yeah, we should do this first.

295
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,721
What?

296
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,685
You wash up. You got some pussy on you.

297
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,482
Key to a healthy marriage.

298
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,489
Oh, that's Maggie, huh?

299
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,643
Hey. What's with your fucking nose?

300
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,606
Nothing, man. Sorry. Forget it.

301
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,602
I get a connotation being implied here
about my wife?

302
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,810
Are you saying that's wife,
that high tide you're walking in with?

303
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,689
You got some idea
how my wife's pussy is supposed to smell?

304
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:07,251
No, I just meant you're wearing
the same clothes as you did yesterday,

305
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,404
coupled with the fact that I ain't stupid.

306
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,842
I wasn't making no comment
as to the particularity of the scent.

307
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,965
You don't say fuck-all about my wife.

308
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,449
Don't say her name.

309
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,166
You got some self-loathing
to do this morning, that's fine,

310
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,248
but it ain't worth losing your hands over.

311
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,166
And how would that work, exactly?

312
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,003
Well, I'd just apply
a couple pounds of pressure,

313
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,490
snap your wrists.

314
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,330
You're senior detective.

315
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,490
Think I'm lying?

316
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,486
You got a specific location for this place

317
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,848
or are we just gonna wander around
till we find it?

318
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,445
I got some names.

319
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,771
I'm gonna have to ask for directions.

320
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,521
Maybe you could just follow your nose.

321
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,122
Wherever he picked them up,

322
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,366
I mean, I won't lie, however we left it,

323
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,484
he had some moves.

324
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,645
He knew a few CIs from his narco days.

325
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,168
They knew these parts,

326
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,926
put us in touch with some names,
people to talk to.

327
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,126
How we doing, boys?

328
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,440
- Hey.
- Hello.

329
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:21,162
We're looking for a little bunny ranch
down around these parts.

330
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,607
- Y'all know where we could find it?
- No, sir.

331
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,411
- Never heard about it? Little whorehouse?
- Nuh-uh.

332
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,840
Sorry, man.

333
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,247
Supposed to be stuck up in the woods
around here?

334
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,600
I'll tell you this,

335
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,765
Rust had about as sharp an eye for weakness
as I ever seen.

336
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,809
I'll be right back.

337
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,970
It's my bad, boys.

338
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,566
Maybe we got started on
the wrong foot there.

339
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,641
Aah!

340
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,971
Aah!

341
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,242
You remember
where that little whorehouse is?

342
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,323
Take 353 south.

343
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,721
Gotta exit off the shoulder
before we get to the 14.

344
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,441
From there, we take a dirt fishing road
to Bayou Chenault.

345
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,561
Okay.

346
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,766
That it?

347
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,446
Mmm-hmm.

348
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,165
Cop car, y'all.

349
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,681
Whose turn is it for the freebie?

350
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,923
I don't do no cops.
That's on you guys, remember?

351
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,005
Hello, ma'am.

352
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,048
Martin Hart, Rustin Cohle. State CID.

353
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,810
This your place?

354
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,085
It's my lease.

355
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,127
What is this,
some kind of hillbilly bunny ranch?

356
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,531
Excuse me?

357
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,691
You might want to talk to Sheriff Bilson
before you start tossing accusations around.

358
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,763
No, I got nothing against hillbillies.

359
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,931
Relax.
That's not why we're here. We, uh...

360
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,801
Well, something happened to a girl,
and we need to know if any of you knew her.

361
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,404
Yeah. That's Dori.

362
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,447
Something happened?

363
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,525
You know about that woman
found outside of Erath?

364
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,201
Oh, no.

365
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,320
Did something happen to Dori?

366
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,880
Were you pretty
good friends with her?

367
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,884
She was nice to me when
I first came around.

368
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,769
Gave me tips and stuff.

369
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,487
Tips? About what?

370
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,564
Nothing. You know, just how to be.

371
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,406
You got any idea where she might
have been staying the last few weeks?

372
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,680
I don't.

373
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,889
Her ex is in prison.

374
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,040
I guess maybe she got a new place.

375
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,442
She'd been going to church.

376
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,243
I was hoping
maybe she just turned things around.

377
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,164
We're gonna need to question
any girls might have known her.

378
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,920
That's a tougher ask than you think.

379
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,441
Folks'll be staying away,
they hear y'all are out here.

380
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,729
Well, ma'am,
it's the best way to get us to leave.

381
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,602
- You said she left a bag?
- Yeah.

382
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,885
Can I see it?

383
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,086
Sure.

384
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,169
That girl's not 18.

385
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,131
Sheriff know you got underage working here?

386
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,404
What do you know
about where that girl's been?

387
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,404
Where she come from?

388
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,642
You want to know Beth's situation,

389
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,803
before she ran out on her uncle?

390
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,251
There are other places she could go.

391
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,970
Such holy bullshit from you.

392
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,327
It's a woman's body, ain't it?

393
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,881
A woman's choice.

394
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,891
Well, she don't look like a woman to me.

395
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:52,605
At that age, she is not equipped
to make those kind of choices.

396
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,367
But I guess you don't give a shit
what kind of damage she's doing to herself

397
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,930
as long as you're making your money.

398
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,210
Girls walk this earth all the time
screwing for free.

399
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,484
Now, why is it you add business to the mix,
and boys like you can't stand the thought?

400
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,050
I'll tell you.

401
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,010
It's 'cause suddenly you don't own it
the way you thought you did.

402
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,846
Ahem.

403
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,923
Ma'am, you've both
been very helpful.

404
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,565
We'll be in touch.

405
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,841
Yes, thank you for your help.

406
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,724
Do something else.

407
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,606
That a down payment?

408
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,928
Is shitting on any moment of decency
part of your job description?

409
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,929
"I closed my eyes and saw The King in
Yellow moving through the forest."

410
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,722
This is her diary, Marty.

411
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,611
Believe this shit? A girl that young?

412
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,602
You know the sheriff has got a stake
in this place, too.

413
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,205
Fucking Christ.

414
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,967
"The King's children were marked.

415
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,248
"They became his angels."

416
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,764
The Yellow King, Carcosa.

417
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,966
Nut job.

418
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,568
Fried her brain on whatever she was on.

419
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,564
Sounds like she didn't have much
to begin with.

420
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,927
Well, it reads like fantasy.

421
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,726
What if he was dosing her regular,

422
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:04,647
and over a period of time, upping the dose
little by little without her knowing?

423
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,771
We should stay out here today,
check around for johns, maybe knew her.

424
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,450
Look at this.

425
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,569
Oh, yeah. Man, a lot of these type places.

426
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,726
Expect the flock to canvass for them.

427
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,249
You know, we should go there.
Could be the church everyone mentioned.

428
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,130
Well, let's check around for johns
while we're out here

429
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,487
And pick up the church on Monday.

430
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,211
Most of your
stuff's still redacted.

431
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,370
Now, what's Northshore?

432
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,571
Northshore Psychiatric Hospital.

433
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,161
Lubbock, Texas.
I spent four months there in '93.

434
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,201
- You feel like talking about that?
- Well, sure.

435
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,690
Who gives a shit?

436
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:07,484
Sofia, my daughter,
she was on her tricycle in our driveway.

437
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,966
Um...

438
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,727
We lived on... We were in a
little bend in the road, and...

439
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,044
They said that...

440
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,043
Anyway, afterwards, uh,

441
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,730
Claire and I turned on
each other, you know.

442
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,803
We... We resented each other
for being alive, you know.

443
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,570
I transferred from Robbery to Narco.

444
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,926
Started hitting it, you know, 24/7.

445
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,682
Street rips, knocking down doors.

446
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,162
Within three months I was
ripping off couriers

447
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,290
or ending up in a Ramada Inn
with a couple of fucking eight-balls.

448
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,771
Oh, yeah.

449
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,607
Somewhere in there Claire left,

450
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,048
and somewhere in there
I emptied a .9 into a crankhead

451
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,283
for injecting his infant
daughter with crystal.

452
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,321
Said he was trying to purify her.

453
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,690
State Attorney gave me one chance
to stay out of jail.

454
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,607
He said, "You can keep your profile,
but we wanna make you our wildman junkie."

455
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,283
So they did.
They made me a floater, like a trick.

456
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,445
You know, any agency or department
needed a deep undercover narco,

457
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,011
they got me.

458
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,129
And there was no fucking expiration date,
baby.

459
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,970
And they kept you out there for four years?

460
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,405
Mmm-hmm.

461
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:55,731
In February of '93, I killed three
cartel men at the Port of Houston.

462
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,769
I took three .25s in the side

463
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,925
and ended up at Northshore
Psychiatric Hospital in Lubbock, Texas.

464
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,440
Which is kind of funny in its own right.

465
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,046
Psych ward being in Lubbock, Texas.

466
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,009
You ever been there?

467
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,601
They offered me a psych pension.

468
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,525
Jackpot, right?

469
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,166
I said no.
I said, "Put me on Homicide somewhere."

470
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,565
By then, I was owed quite a few favors,

471
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,929
and, uh, Louisiana was what they had.

472
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,807
Yeah, for a long time after, I...
I didn't really sleep.

473
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,371
Nightmares, PTSD,
exhausted nerves, whatever.

474
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,046
Yeah.

475
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,370
Why Homicide?

476
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,681
Oh, something I saw at Northshore.

477
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,249
Quote from Corinthians.

478
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,091
"The body is not one member, but many.

479
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,731
"Now are they many,

480
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,004
"but of one body."

481
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,764
What's that mean, though?

482
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,290
I was just trying to stay
a part of the body now.

483
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,768
The fishing pole's not working.

484
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,842
- Just ask Grandpa.
- No.

485
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,131
- Yeah.
- Grandpa, I can't tell if it's working.

486
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,090
You'll know, honey. It'll yank at you hard.

487
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,807
- Okay.
- Why don't you...

488
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,406
How's that case going? The big one?

489
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,729
Working it, you know.

490
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,286
Things like that didn't happen these parts
when I was young.

491
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,931
People said "ma'am" and "sir."

492
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,002
Families stayed together.

493
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,447
Yeah, that's how it was, huh?

494
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,450
Not all the time.

495
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,049
There was more dignity.

496
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,966
Everyone wasn't out in the street,
yelling about their rights.

497
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:42,481
Well, if things were so great,
they never would have changed.

498
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,961
Hmm.

499
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,565
Nothing is going on.

500
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,962
I'm just saying, if there's a problem,
you can talk to me. You know that.

501
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,566
If I have a problem with someone,
I talk to them, Ma.

502
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,722
Well, you should be able to talk to me.

503
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,804
I know what it's like
to be married to a man.

504
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,048
You think they're all the same, huh?

505
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:03,322
I don't know why you're so rude to me. If
you're frustrated, don't take it out on me.

506
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,248
I think that you need
to get your cable fixed

507
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,687
and stop confusing me
with your soap operas.

508
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,167
Well, you beat up on
what you can't control.

509
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,848
Makes it bad for everybody else.

510
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,607
- I don't know how.
- I don't care. Just try.

511
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,523
- You do it.
- I can't.

512
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,570
You have smaller fingers.

513
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,290
Macie, just do it.

514
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,251
So, you're telling me
the world isn't getting worse?

515
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:32,685
I've seen kids today, all in black,
wearing makeup, shit on their faces.

516
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,730
Everything's sex.

517
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,520
Clinton.

518
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,128
You know, throughout history,

519
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,363
I bet every old man
probably said the same thing.

520
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,849
And old men die,
and the world keeps spinning.

521
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,646
- Honey, I got this lead...
- How are the girls?

522
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,080
I got this lead I wanted to check up on.
I told you about it.

523
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:02,123
- Maybe your dad could bring you back.
- No. You didn't tell me anything about it.

524
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,043
This is a family day.

525
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,200
I did tell you about it. I mentioned it.

526
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,964
It's the new case.

527
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,487
Okay, well, how about
we all head back, then?

528
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,325
Hmm. All right, sweetheart.

529
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,810
Come on! Let's go!

530
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,564
Our lines tangled.

531
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,649
- Just paddle in.
- Okay.

532
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,281
Told you!

533
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,521
- Thanks for the lovely afternoon.
- Oh.

534
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,611
Thank you.

535
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,521
Afternoon, sir.

536
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,571
- How you doing today, Officer?
- I have a question for you.

537
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,608
You ever seen this girl?

538
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,247
- You never seen her before?
- Never before.

539
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,367
How about you?

540
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,880
Question.

541
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,406
I'm looking for this young lady.
Do you recognize her?

542
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,444
I might need a memory jog.

543
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,688
Dora. Young blonde?

544
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,482
Dora. Dora, Dora, Dora, Dora.

545
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,161
Dora.

546
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:54,286
Have any guys come around lately
looking for anything more than a good time?

547
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,131
You might be able to remember
for a little more money?

548
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,009
- I might.
- You might?

549
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,325
Years, we've been through this.

550
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,282
Sweetheart, listen to me.
There is nowhere else I want to be.

551
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,881
I wonder if you even know you're lying.

552
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,646
Oh, come on!

553
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,721
Shh.

554
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:27,606
Bad enough the shit I got to wade through
on a daily basis,

555
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,047
bring me this "feel bad for me" crap

556
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,887
when I work 30 hours straight

557
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,527
and spent the weekend
listening to your dad's bullshit.

558
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:42,490
I come home, the one place where
there's supposed to be peace and calm,

559
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,440
- and you throw this shit...
- Who told you that?

560
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,001
It's not always that way.
It's not supposed to be.

561
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,209
It's supposed to be what I want.
It's supposed to help me.

562
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,250
We do help you! All the goddamn time!

563
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,131
Okay, well, what do you want me to say?

564
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,767
You want me to talk about the woman,
had antlers?

565
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,650
Do you want me to tell you
about the kids disappearing,

566
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:11,611
and maybe you'll stop
with the "poor me" little whiny bullshit?

567
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,688
Is that what you're saying, hmm?

568
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,930
That I'm trying to make
you feel bad for me?

569
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,967
Is that really how you want to play this?

570
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,010
No, honey.

571
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,323
I think you're the
greatest woman I ever met,

572
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,404
and you're the greatest thing
that ever happened to me.

573
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,966
But, yeah, you know, sometimes

574
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,963
I think you might have a penchant
for self-pity.

575
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,526
And right now I need you to be strong
so that I can do my job.

576
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,803
You have developed
some sort of selective deafness.

577
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,371
You used to not be such a chicken shit,
I swear.

578
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,122
Even your mom thinks you're a ball-buster.

579
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,969
Tell the girls, dinner.

580
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,485
Mmm.

581
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,811
You don't have
a mommy or daddy anymore.

582
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,321
Yeah, they just died in an accident.

583
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,441
HOW?

584
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,002
In a car accident. Someone...

585
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,606
Dinnertime, kids. Go to the kitchen.

586
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,970
Are you coming?

587
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,647
- Yeah, of course. I'm starving.
- Really?

588
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,850
Yeah, really.

589
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,401
Good.

590
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,485
You know,
I think about my daughter now.

591
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,725
And what...

592
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,009
What she was spared.

593
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,728
Sometimes I feel grateful.

594
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:27,449
Doctors said she didn't feel a thing,
went straight into a coma.

595
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,488
And then, somewhere in that

596
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,571
blackness, she slipped off into another

597
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,485
deeper kind.

598
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,851
Isn't that a beautiful way to go out?

599
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,765
Painlessly.

600
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,050
As a happy child.

601
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,600
Hmm.

602
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:05,529
Yeah, trouble with dying later
is you've already grown up.

603
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,767
Damage is done. It's too late.

604
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,040
You got kids?

605
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,001
Mmm.

606
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:21,929
I think of the hubris it must take to

607
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:29,289
yank a soul out of nonexistence
into this meat.

608
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,681
And to force a life into this thresher.

609
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,601
And as for my daughter, she, uh...

610
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,930
she spared me the sin of being a father.

611
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,330
Hi, Cathleen, you little vixen.

612
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,131
- Any chance of some coffee?
- Of course.

613
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,446
Okay.

614
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,490
Who are these guys?

615
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,688
Some assholes Quesada brought in.

616
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,285
Coffee on its way.

617
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,925
- Hey, morning, Marty.
- Hey.

618
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,810
Major's introducing me
to the new flying squad.

619
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,966
You know Mark Daughtry, Ted Bertrand.

620
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,646
Daughtry.

621
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,767
Ted.

622
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,127
- Jimmy Dufrene.
- Jimmy Dufrene.

623
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,931
What's up?

624
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,562
We've been tasked with investigating crimes
with possible occult links.

625
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,247
There's been a rash of animal mutilations,
cemeteries defiled.

626
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,084
And they want to see
what we have on the Lange case.

627
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,207
Uh-huh.

628
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,365
Well, this task force is important to
the commander and to the governor's office.

629
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,171
You know, a lot of people
are concerned about it.

630
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,164
You know, me, I don't see the connection

631
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,084
between two dead cats
and a murdered woman.

632
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,246
But then, I'm from Texas.

633
00:48:46,095 --> 00:48:47,656
We're not stepping on your toes, Marty.

634
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,445
We just got the mandate.
We got to compare notes with what you got.

635
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,601
Yeah.

636
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,762
- Here you are, Detective.
- No. Thanks, Cathleen.

637
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:54,921
You got it.

638
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,001
Xerox all you want.

639
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,887
Make you feel like good cops.

640
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,004
You two, my office.

641
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,883
Cohle, we got a new rule
around here, especially for you.

642
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:20,205
You got an opinion about anything,
you hold on to it.

643
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:26,120
You hold on to it or you tell it to Marty.
Otherwise, button your big, fat mouth.

644
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,646
However smart you are,
you're not as smart as you think.

645
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,404
Are you serious, boss?

646
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:37,164
This God-bothering shit, it's a
political circle-jerk. You know this.

647
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,242
Is this a place you live?

648
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,405
Where are you, huh?

649
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,401
You had anything in the last weeks?
You got a suspect?

650
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,643
Give us some more guys
to follow up KAs, track records.

651
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:52,247
No, our bosses don't want you at all,
you understand?

652
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,970
I don't want you.

653
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,926
You are upright
only by the grace of this man's reputation.

654
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,406
Goddamn, Cohle.

655
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:02,723
How many ways are there for me to say,
"Shut the fuck up"?

656
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,966
I mean, we work under command, right?

657
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,326
Now, our betters want
a public, high-profile show of response.

658
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:18,481
Shit, I got a state senator, he's trying
to label Satanic graffiti as a hate crime.

659
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,530
That has nothing to do with our DB,
and that's the fact of it.

660
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,843
Okay, okay. Fine.
Let's say that's true, all right?

661
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,002
Let's say that you guys
get the case all to yourselves.

662
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,891
You ever solve a murder
been in the red more than a week?

663
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,201
You ever clear one

664
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,760
where two rounds of questions
didn't hand you the fucking answer?

665
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,411
Oh, come on. - No, no, you
got leads, you got a timeline.

666
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,720
You know what I got?

667
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,883
I got a whodunit,
where my two detectives are stalling,

668
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,123
and I got a brand-new task force
wants to take it off our hands.

669
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,330
- We have a lead, boss.
- Oh, for Christ's sake. Fuck off, Cohle.

670
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,641
Christ.

671
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,045
It's your call.

672
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,730
You want to dump this one off?

673
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,203
You ought to think about it,
given the spotlight.

674
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,887
You know, Teddy Bertrand's a
good detective. You know him.

675
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,002
Well, you're a smartass
with your mouth shut.

676
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,244
I was just gonna say
we've got a lead on a church.

677
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,926
Our vic was spending a lot of time there.

678
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,606
That's where we were headed.
It could be the break we need.

679
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:27,811
Inside, whatever they're putting over you,
how much more time could you get us?

680
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,441
Right now, it's up for discussion.

681
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,848
But, you know,
Tuttle's lighting a fire under this.

682
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,604
Without a suspect,

683
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,846
they're just gonna stop asking questions,
Marty, and they're gonna give orders.

684
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,365
That's that.

685
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,368
Give us the rest of the month

686
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,286
before they lump it into whatever the
play is with the task force, yeah?

687
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,440
I'll try.

688
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,960
Two weeks,
and then you two start catching again.

689
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,121
Yeah.

690
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,160
Let's cut to the point.

691
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,850
As the crow flies,

692
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:07,209
y'all are wanting to ask about
that big throw-down in the woods, yeah?

693
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,809
Eventually, sure. Right now, we're
just trying to track the case.

694
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,121
How Cohle worked it, especially.

695
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,443
Which indicates
you think I'm too thick to realize

696
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,770
that y'all are trying to jam somebody up.

697
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,762
You're on to something new.

698
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,085
So Cohle didn't want to give it
to the task force.

699
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,041
Did you?

700
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,126
No, I did not.

701
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,363
It don't make sense.
There is nothing out here.

702
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,481
According to this map,
it should be within these few miles.

703
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:08,606
Well, ahem, I guess if it's one of those
tent revival places, they move around.

704
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,726
Yeah.

705
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,170
Tents usually do.

706
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,763
There's no date on this flyer,
which is strange.

707
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,126
There's something up there.

708
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,731
Wait, wait, back up.
Are you saying you hallucinated on the job?

709
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,801
Mmm.

710
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:24,685
No. I mean, I could always tell what
was real or what wasn't, you know.

711
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,242
So when I'd see things,
fuck, man, I'd just roll with it.

712
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,525
You still see things?

713
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,327
No.

714
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:40,807
No, they stopped altogether
after I was clean a couple years.

715
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,808
No numbers on this place.

716
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,325
Fire must have happened a long time ago.

717
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,651
Okay. Place is trashed.

718
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,402
This ain't no kind of anything.

719
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,767
Yeah, back then, the visions.

720
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,286
Yeah, most of the time,
I was convinced, shit, I'd lost it.

721
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,561
Marty.

722
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,847
But there were other times,

723
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,445
I thought I was mainlining
the secret truth of the universe.
